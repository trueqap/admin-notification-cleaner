# Admin Notification Cleaner

## Description

Admin Notification Cleaner is a curated collection of JavaScript and CSS snippets designed to declutter the WordPress admin interface by removing unnecessary notifications added by plugin developers. The aim is to create a cleaner, more focused admin dashboard to enhance productivity and user experience.

## Features

- **CSS Snippets**: Remove visual clutter with simple CSS.
- **JavaScript Helpers**: Disable intrusive notifications with JavaScript.
- **Gulp Integration**: Easy compilation and minification of SCSS and JS files.

### Prerequisites

Before you can use the Gulp tasks, make sure you have Node.js and npm installed. Then, install Gulp globally if you haven't already:

```bash
npm install --global gulp-cli
```

### Installation

### Using Gulp
